# AI Model Lifecycle Demonstrator: Design, Development & Governance

This repository demonstrates the complete AI model development lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model training, fairness evaluation, and explainability analysis. The project reflects best practices aligned with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and ODNI Responsible AI guidance.

## Structure

- `data/`: UCI Adult Income dataset
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each phase of model development
- `model/`: Saved trained models
- `model_card.md`: Documentation describing the model's purpose, risks, and governance attributes

## Tools

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- Fairlearn
- SHAP
- matplotlib

## Objective

Train a model to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K based on demographic features, while analyzing and mitigating bias.

## Alignment

This project is designed to demonstrate skills relevant to the SAIC ODNI AI Policy Engineer role, including responsible AI implementation, model fairness, and transparent documentation.
